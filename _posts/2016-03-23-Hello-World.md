I’m very excited to finally getting around to setting up my own personal website and blog. I was blogging briefly for a technology and news website which I had co-founded during the summer after my sophomore year, called [TechShala.in](http://techshala.in), based on WordPress and had previous experience of blogging with various other tools like Blogger, Tumblr and Weebly. After much deliberation I have chosen to settle down with Jekyll and Github Pages.
