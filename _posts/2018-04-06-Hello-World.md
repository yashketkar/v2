Iâ€™m so excited to finally set up my personal website and blog. I was blogging briefly for a technology and news website which I had co-founded in the summer of 2013, called [TechShala.in](http://techshala.in), built using WordPress. I had previous experience of blogging with various other tools like Blogger, Webs, Weebly and Wix.

After much deliberation I have chosen to settle down with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com). Although WordPress is a great blogging platform, it did not suit the purpose of this specific blog. It was too slow, heavy as well as expensive to host. Comparatively Jekyll is faster, lighter and free hosting with Github Pages makes it very inexpensive. Plus it also offers support for Markdown.
I'm looking forward to writing more blog posts here. :smile:
