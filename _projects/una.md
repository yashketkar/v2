The United Nations Association at Indiana University was a nonprofit self-run student organization founded on January 1, 2014 which worked on local and international issues, human rights and it also volunteered for various causes.

They were interested in having a website to convey their latest information to all the students at IU, to help promote their various events, to increase the membership of the organization, to advertise about the various causes supported by them and to recieve the donations and funds from various individuals and other organizations. There was a need for them to have a web presence to promote the activities of the organization and for providing their real-time updates to the current and prospective members of the organization.

The website included the following pages: Home, Board, Events, Refugees Welcome Campaign, Donate, Contact.
