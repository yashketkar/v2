As a part of the P532 course at Indiana University, We had to create a game maker using Java in swing. I contributed to developing a generic Game Maker Application in Java that could be used to build and play a range of arcade games. Made extensive use of Java design patterns to implement generic features of the game.

- Features of the application: Save and Load, Sound, Webstartable
- Technologies used: Swing, Bamboo, Fisheye, Log4J, JUnit, Mockito, Maven, Ant.
- Design Patterns used: Singleton, Command, Composite, Factory, Façade, MVC, Observer pattern.
- User can save/load built games, define game rules/actions along with basic game play features.
- Customizable game and future proof implementation, reusable codebase.
