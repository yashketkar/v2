I collaborated and worked with a group on this project. It mainly comprised of two tasks. The first task was to build a Restaurant Category Predictor by training on the features extracted from the given dataset using Bag of Words model and using an SVM classifier. We used the business, review and tip information from the given dataset. Compared the results with Naive Bayes classifier.

For the second task, we used the yelp dataset to help entrepreneurs find the best location to build a successful restaurant. We used various python libraries like gensim, nltk. The dataset was loaded in a Mongo DB database using pymongo and the results were displayed in a Jupyter IPython notebook.
