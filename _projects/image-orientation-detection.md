In this project, we were given images from Flickr in random orientations. We detected the correct orientation using three different machine learning techniquies namely KNNs, Neural Networks and AdaBoost. I mainly worked on the Adaboost method for detecting the correct orientation of the image.

Note: The images above are of very low resolution since they were scaled down for feature extraction.
