I created this native Android application in 2014. It helps a student track their attendance in class by allowing them to input their attendance and see statistics and helpful tips about it. I used Java and XML for creating the application. The app was created using the Android Studio IDE along with Gradle for building and dependency management.

I used Android Support Libraries for supporting older versions of Android while using and maintaining the features from the then latest Android APIs. I used the Google Play Servies library for accessing various Google APIs, like AdMob for monetization using banner and interstitial ads. I also incorporated the Google Analytics library for measuring and tracking usage patterns of users. I later created a developer account and published this app on the Google Play Store. It currently has about 10-50k installations with 4.2 star rating from 400+ reviews.
