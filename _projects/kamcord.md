I wrote this Android app as a part of an interview round. I was given the following requirements:

<object data="/assets/docs/AndroidProgrammingChallengev3FINALFINAL.pdf" width="100%" height="100%" type='application/pdf'>
   <p><b>Note:</b> This browser does not support PDFs. Please download the PDF to view it: <a href="/assets/docs/AndroidProgrammingChallengev3FINALFINAL.pdf">Download PDF</a>.</p>
</object>

You can view my solution and the code for this problem from the link in the sidebar.

Note: Kamcord has joined Lyft and their website, app or api does not exist anymore, So this project would not be usable in it's current form anymore.
You can read more about Kamcord joining Lyft [here](https://medium.com/@Kamcord/were-joining-lyft-d1bb6523ac90).
