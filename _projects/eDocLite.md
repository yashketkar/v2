eDocLite is a service which allows for the creation of simple web-based forms using the Kuali Enterprise Workflow engine<sup>[1](#1)</sup>. It required entering lots of complex XML to create a form, thus creating the need to have an easy to use tool to generate the XML.

A video presentation about eDocLite and it's use case:

I worked in a team of 5 (including me) to build this application, it was created as a part of the Spring 2016 [P632 class](https://www.sice.indiana.edu/graduate/courses/index.html?number=p632&department=csci) at Indiana University, along with guidance and mentoring from the staff at [UITS](https://uits.iu.edu).

We developed an easy to use web-based form builder which is drag and drop, has simple validation, ability to interface with external REST services, saving data to a database and send emails. We used React.js and ECMAScript 2015/16 for the User Interface. Used Travis CI for Continuous Integration and Build and Test Automation. We used scrum which is an iterative and incremental agile software development methodology for managing product development.
