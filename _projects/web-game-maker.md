Developed a generic Game Maker application for the Web using HTML5 that can be used to build and play a range of arcade style games. Used Phaser.js as a game engine to support the game maker. Collaborated with Abhijit Karanjkar on this project, I mainly worked on the front-end game maker part and he focused on the back-end functionality such as login and saving to database using Spring MVC and MySQL.

Key Features:
- Technologies used: HTML, Javascript, CSS, Maven and Spring MVC.
- User can save/load built games, define game rules/actions along with basic game play features.
- Customizable game and future proof implementation, reusable Codebase.
